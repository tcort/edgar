Here are some ideas for things to work on:

* support for floating point numbers.
* support for strings.
* input with readline or libedit.
* i18n with gettext.
* write more tests.
* write unit tests of individual C functions.
* find and fix bugs.
* support multiple arguments for PLUS/MINUS/TIMES/QUOTIENT/...
