= TODO List

Here are some things that need work. Feel free to pick some tasks from this
list and start working on them.

New features should come with documentation (i.e. update the man page)
as well as some tests.

== Core (new features)

* support for floating point numbers.
* support multiple arguments for PLUS/MINUS/TIMES/QUOTIENT/...
* support additional functions.

== Core (improvements)

* input with readline or libedit.
* i18n with gettext.

== Documentation

* a written manual (use texinfo, asciidoc, markdown, docbook, or something similar).

== QA

* write more tests.
  * functional tests of the interpreter.
  * unit tests of the individual functions.
  * regression tests when bugs are fixed.
* find and fix bugs.
